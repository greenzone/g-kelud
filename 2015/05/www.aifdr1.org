    The Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR)
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    2008-2015

<p dir="ltr">
    The Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR) is now officially closed. However, the Australian Government, through the Department of
    Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), will continue to support Indonesia in the disaster management sector and to build on the success of Australia&#8217;s disaster
    risk reduction program.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    AIFDR was a joint initiative by the Australian and Indonesian governments to &quot;strengthen national and local capacity in disaster management in Indonesia
    and create a more disaster resilient region&quot;.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Over the life of the AIFDR, activities were undertaken in three program areas: training &amp; outreach; partnerships; and risk &amp; vulnerability
    (implemented by Geoscience Australia). As a partnership initiative, AIFDR developed solid bilateral ties with Indonesia in the sector including with
    Indonesia&#8217;s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Using innovative Australian and Indonesian science, AIFDR worked with the Government of Indonesia technical agencies and universities to build scientific
    evidence, software technologies and training to help Indonesia manage the risk associated with natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunami, volcanos and
    floods. These activities complemented AIFDR&#8217;s suite of disaster management capacity building programs at the national, provincial and district level.
    Through partnerships with Non-Government Organisations and Civil Society Organisations, AIFDR supported community resilience to disasters in five
    provinces. AIFDR also supported regional disaster risk management through partnerships with ASEAN and the United Nations.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    DFAT&#8217;s new three year (2015-2018) disaster management investment in Indonesia will continue to provide support to strengthen Indonesia&#8217;s ability to respond
    to a large-scale disaster, through science innovation, policy collaboration as well as humanitarian response following a disaster. We will continue to work
    closely with the Government of Indonesia, including BNPB, counterpart science and disaster management agencies, the private sector and relevant
    stakeholders (including UN agencies and faith based organisations).
